**Purpose**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of security vulnerability where an attacker tricks a victim into performing actions on a web application in which the victim is authenticated, without the victim's knowledge or consent

**How It Works**:

- **Victim Authentication**:  The victim logs into a web application (e.g., their bank) and receives a session cookie.
- **Crafted Malicious Request**:   The attacker creates a malicious web page or email containing a request that targets the web application where the victim is authenticated. The request could be a form submission, image tag, script, or AJAX request that triggers an action on the target web application (e.g., transferring money).
- **Victim Interaction**: The victim visits the malicious website or clicks on the malicious link while still logged into the target web application. The victimâ€™s browser includes the session cookie with the request because the browser automatically sends cookies for the relevant domain.
- **Unauthorized Action**: The target web application processes the request using the victim's session cookie, believing it to be a legitimate request from the victim.


**Prevention Techniques**:

- **CSRF Tokens**: Including unique tokens in forms and validating them server-side.
- **SameSite Cookies**: Setting cookies with the `SameSite` attribute to prevent them from being sent with cross-site requests.
- **Referer/Origin Checking**: Validating the `Referer` or `Origin` header to ensure requests come from trusted sources (can also help with [[CORS]])
- **User Interaction**: Requiring explicit user actions for sensitive operations (e.g., CAPTCHAs, re-entering passwords).
