## Definition

Majority of software cost comes from maintenance. Software should be designed with maintainability in mind

- Operability: Make it easy for operation teams to keep the software running
- Simplicity: Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system (limit accidental complexity)
- Evolvability: Make it easy to make changes and adapt the system to new requirements
