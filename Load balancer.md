## Definition

Type of reverse [[Proxy]] that distribute client requests to servers / databases and returns response to client.

Load balancers make systems more [[Reliability |reliable]] by :

- Preventing requests from going to unhealthy servers
- Preventing overloading resources
- Helping eliminate single points of failure

Load balancers themselves can be horizontally scaled to avoid being a single point of failure.

Note: they can usually handle very high throughput

## Strategies

- Round robin: 1st request goes to 1st server, 2nd to 2nd,...
- Weighted round robin: Each server handle a percentage of traffic
- least active connections
- user location based
- Hashing (IP, request, uid,...)

## Types

### Layer 4 LB

- Transport layer LB
- Forwards network packets to and from the upstream server
- Faster but not flexible (strategies limited to simple ones such as round robin, IP hashing,...)

### Layer 7 LB

- Flexible: can use application data to decide where to forward: can involve contents of the header, message, and cookies
- slower: Â terminates network traffic, reads the message, makes a load-balancing decision, then opens a connection to the selected server
