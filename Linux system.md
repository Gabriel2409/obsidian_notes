[[Process]] (user process) = running programs that the kernel manages - collectively they make up the user space (part of the main memory that processes can access)

[[Kernel]] runs in kernel mode = unrestricted access to hardware

User processes (even those run by root) are run in user mode = access restricted to a set of memory and safe CPU operations
