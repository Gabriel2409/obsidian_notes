The vanishing gradient problem occurs during the training of deep neural networks when the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters (weights) of the network become extremely small as they are backpropagated through the network, especially in deep layers.

As gradients are backpropagated, they are multiplied by the gradients of successive layers.
As most [[Activation function]] constrain the value between 0 and 1, if there are too many layers, this multiplication leads the gradients to decay exponentially until they become so small they don't update the weights, which means learning stops.

Skip connections can help by providing a direct path for gradient flow from deeper layers to earlier layers during backpropagation.
