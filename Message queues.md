#sd 

An asynchronous system is one where the client sends the request and does not wait for the message to be delivered. The clientâ€™s message is not immediately sent over to the processing system but instead sent to an intermediary. This intermediary is the message queue or the broker.

- Producers are the systems that produce the messages.
- Consumers are the systems that process those messages.
- Message Queue or topic is the link between the producers and the consumers.
- Producers publish the messages to a named queue, and the queue delivers these messages to the consumer of the queue.

Advantages:
- Prevent overload of the CPU 
- Expensive messages can be held and processing can occur after
- Queues can deliver messages to multiple systems
- Decoupling of client and server by eliminating the need to know the server address
