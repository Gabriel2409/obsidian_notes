## Overview

- data labeling where training data is labeled using sources of information that may not be entirely accurate or may contain noise (cheaper)
- goal is to train machine learning models using this imperfectly labeled data while mitigating the noise and errors introduced by the weak sources.
- particularly useful in scenarios where obtaining high-quality manual annotations for a large dataset is costly, time-consuming, or infeasible. 
- Handling noise and conflicts in the labels introduced by the labeling functions is a primary challenge in weak supervision. Models must effectively account for and reduce this noise during training.

## Key concepts

### Labeling Functions (LFs)

- Heuristic or rule-based functions that generate labels for data points based on specific patterns (for ex key word, regex), domain knowledge, etc...
- LFs may produce noisy or conflicting labels, and they can be of varying quality.

### Label Matrix

- representation of the labels generated by the collection of labeling functions. 
- row = data point index
- column = labeling function index
- value = label provided by the LF (or -1 (`ABSTAIN`) if the LF was not able to label this specific point )



### Combination Model (e.g., LabelModel)


 - statistical or machine learning model that combines the outputs of multiple labeling functions to estimate the true labels of the data points.
- The combination model accounts for the fact that some LFs may be more accurate or reliable than others and that there may be correlations and dependencies between them (how?).

 ### Probabilistic Modeling
 
   - Weak supervision often involves probabilistic modeling to estimate the accuracy and reliability of each labeling function and the true labels. This is typically done through a generative model that explains the relationship between the observed noisy labels, the true labels, and the labeling function accuracies.
   - (need to investigate that)

### Data Augmentation and Iterative Refinement

To improve label quality, data augmentation techniques like bootstrapping or iterative refinement may be applied
